I've had this Crea MS2 phone that's been lying around for a while. One boring afternoon and I started to think that maybe I can do something with it. I've actually used it way back then and I was excited to see a phone that can run fully fledged Windows, but yeah, I've had my hopes up too much because soon I realized that it was running a mobile version of it.
